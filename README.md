# scribblegram
[Scribblegram](http://webdevils.com/scribblegram/) is a simple drawing program. You can build the app yourself, or download 
the app from the app store [here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scribblegram/id955086437?mt=8&uo=4). 

The premise was to create a simple drawing app. The app allows you to choose from a range of colors, set the size and opacity
of the brush. Overall this is not a great app since it doesn't solve and existing problem. People with phones would rather 
take a piture than draw one! That said it was a great learning experience. The drawing portion of the app makes use of 
Core Graphics, and Multithreading. 

#Saving Drawings
The app allows drawings to be saved to your photo library. Drawings can also be posted to Twitter, or FaceBook.
